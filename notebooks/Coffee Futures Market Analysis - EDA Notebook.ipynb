    "### Matthew Garton - February 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** The purpose of this notebook is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on my coffee dataset, to examine relationships between variables, distributions, and try to determine which variables will be most useful for predicting coffee prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: The ultimate goal of my project is to develop trading signals for coffee futures. I will attempt to build a machine learning model which uses fundamental and technical data to predict the future direction of coffee futures price changes. My expectation at the outset of this project is that my feature matrix will include data on weather, GDP, and coffee production and exports in major coffee-producing nations, GDP and coffee import data in major coffee-importing nations, as well as volume, open-interest, and commitment of traders data for ICE coffee futures contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook imports a cleaner dataset that I prepared in the Data Wrangling Notebook, called CoffeeDataset. See '../data/' for all of the raw data that I started with, or the links in the Data Wrangling Notebook to get the data directly from the source."
